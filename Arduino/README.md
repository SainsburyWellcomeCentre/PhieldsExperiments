## Installation instructions
Download and install the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
Any version after 2.x.x should be compatible with it.

Add the libraries folder from this repo to the Arduino IDE sketchbook location (You can check the location in File->Preferences).

Open the sketch "StepperTest" and upload it to the test Arduino. The sketch should be compatible with any Arduino using the Atmega 168 or 328 chip variants. The board used in the initial tests was an Arduino Nano with an Atmega 328P (old bootloader).
